Al's Hockey Manager is an icehockey simulation game. Play with your favorite team in any league you want against AI teams.
I'm working with Eclipse 4.2 with the e(fx)clipse plugin and JavaFX SDK 2.2.
The application runs with JavaSE-1.7.
This game was written in 1998-1999 by me using Borland C++ Builder, and converted to Java FX in 2012.
Known issues and bugs are listed in the file "todo.txt".
