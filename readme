Al's Hockey Manager is an icehockey simulation game. Play with your favorite team in any league you want against AI teams.
I'm working with Eclipse 4.3.2 with the Java JDK 8 installed.
An old version of a runnable jar-file (running on JavaSE7) can be downloaded here: http://www.ergon.ch/mitarbeiter/MeyerAlbin/hockeymanager.html
This game was written in 1998-1999 by me using Borland C++ Builder, and converted to Java FX in 2012.
Known issues and bugs are listed in the file "todo.txt".
